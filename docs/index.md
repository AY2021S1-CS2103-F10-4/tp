McScheduler is a **one-stop solution for McDonald's Shift Managers to manage shift scheduling and worker
contact/compensation, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI).

* If you are interested in using McScheduler, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing McScheduler, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
